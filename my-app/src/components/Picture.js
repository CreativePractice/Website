                    <p>

                        Creative Practice is a group composed of medical students and 
                        faculty who believe that artistic expression is a vital part 
                        of medical education. Our purpose is to promote artistic expression 
                        in any number of ways among students and faculty as a means of 
                        enriching our lives and those of the patients that we help care for. 
                        We believe that art and creative expression should be included among 
                        the many credentials of a doctor. Some of the events we have done in 
                        the past are the rededication of the Maren Room, dancing for or creating 
                        art with patients on the wards, and painting lessons. We have an online 
                        website featuring medical student artwork, music, dancing, and other
                        ways of creatively expressing yourself. Please stay tuned for similar 
                        fun and exciting future events!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creative Practice tries to highlight and encourage the continued 
                        creative expression of medical students. This expression can come 
                        in a wide variety of ways such as dancing, playing musical instruments 
                        or just making funny youtube videos. The goal of this club is to provide 
                        opportunities for students to practice an art that may have otherwise 
                        be neglected in their busy lives.

                    <h2>What is White Coat Company?</h2>
                    <p>
                        One amazing part of our group is the White Coat Company. It is a chance to 
                        step into the role of an actor, singer, or dancer and just get out there and 
                        bring some fun to the pediatric patients at Shands, disabled kids/adults in 
                        the community, and even to our classmates, friends, and families at UFCOM’s 
                        Friends and Family Day! It is an entirely student-run amateur theater production – 
                        from the directors and scriptwriters to the participants, to the musicians, sets, 
                        costumes, and props. In the past, we have put on abridged versions of shows such as Aladdin, 
                        Hercules, The Little Mermaid, and Lion King. Please look forward to this year’s productions of 
                        Frozen and Moana, and don’t hesitate to join! No prior experience is necessary to participate. 
                        Make sure to look out for more information on tryouts if you are interested in a show role! 
                        Please contact any of the officers if you would be willing to help with set/props/costumes or 
                        any other creative ideas for the shows.
